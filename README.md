Project Name: Letter Recognition with Machine Learning

Project Description:
This project involves the development of a machine learning model for recognizing handwritten letters. The goal is to create a classifier that can accurately identify different letters of the alphabet based on preprocessed and extracted features from the handwritten data. The project involves data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation.

Tools & Technologies Used:

--MATLAB
--Machine Learning Toolbox
--Datastore for handling raw data files
--k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) classifier
--Bagged ensemble of decision trees

Project Details:

1. Data Preparation: The project starts by creating a datastore to manage raw data files containing handwritten letters in text format. The data undergoes preprocessing steps to normalize time, fix aspect ratio, center coordinates, and scale them. Derivatives are calculated and smoothed to obtain meaningful features.

2. Feature Extraction: Features are extracted from the preprocessed data. These features include aspect ratio, mean absolute deviation of coordinates and derivatives, correlations between signals, and counts of local minima and maxima.

3. Model Training and Evaluation:

--k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) Model: A kNN classifier is trained on the preprocessed data with various configurations. Different values of k, along with options like standardization and distance weighting, are explored.
--Bagged Ensemble of Trees Model: An ensemble of bagged decision trees is trained to compare its performance against the kNN model.

4. Model Evaluation: The trained models are evaluated using a test dataset. The loss function is used to assess classification performance. The confusion matrix and a confusion chart are used to visualize classification results.

5. Misclassification Analysis: Misclassified instances are analyzed to understand where the model struggles. Misclassification rates for each letter are computed and visualized in a bar chart. Examples of misclassified instances are plotted using the raw data files.

Project Achievements:

Developed a machine learning pipeline for recognizing handwritten letters.
Explored different configurations of kNN models, including varying k values and applying distance weighting.
Experimented with an ensemble of bagged decision trees and evaluated its performance.
Analyzed misclassification patterns, identified letters with higher misclassification rates, and visualized misclassified instances.
This project demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques for handwritten character recognition. It involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and analysis. The kNN and ensemble models provide insights into different approaches for achieving accurate letter recognition. The misclassification analysis offers valuable insights into areas where the model can be improved.
